<strong>The Task:</strong>
<p>As a marketplace for luxury goods we want to be able to price items automatically. 
For simplicity purposes you can assume that the only item type being sold through Worthy is a diamond. Diamonds can be categorized by their Carat Weight, Cut, Color and Clarity.
The calculation should be done based on the companyâ€™s past deals. Please add a new feature to enable this.</p> 

<strong>General Instructions:</strong> 
<ul>
  <li>The code should be done in ROR / NodeJS with any framework.</li>
  <li>You can make common assumptions if needed, just mention them in your submission.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Advantages:</strong> 
<ul>
  <li>Create a client side representation of the calculator</li>
  <li>Imagination and creativity - surprise us!</li>
</ul>
